# Key Performance Indicator(KPI's) and it's requirement : - Donâ€™t just Measure. Measure what matters.

 Key performance indicators (KPIs) are the tool of choice for any professional: They are metrics used when devising strategies, when measuring performance, and when setting goals. They help decision-making by bringing objectives into the foreground and by providing a framework for analysis. KPIs are one of several frameworks helping organizations progress in the desired direction.

The HR department is responsible for monitoring and managing various aspects of employee data to ensure the organization maintains a healthy workforce. However, there is a lack of clear performance indicators to track and analyze key HR metrics. Therefore, there is a need to design and implement a set of KPIs to address the following points:

# 1. Employee count :
The HR department lacks visibility into the total number of employees, making it challenging to assess workforce size and plan for future growth or downsizing effectively. 

# 2. Attrition count :
The organization lacks a standardized method to track employee attrition, resulting in incomplete and unreliable data on the number of employees who have left the organization.

# 3. Attrition rate :
Without a clear measure of the attrition rate, the organization cannot assess the overall turnover level or compare it with industry benchmarks, hindering the ability to gauge employee satisfaction and engagement.

# 4. Active Employees :
The organization lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive employees, leading to difficulties in accurately assessing the current workforce's productivity and capacity.

# 5. Average age :
The HR department lacks visibility into the average age of employees, making it difficult to evaluate the workforce demographics, succession planning, and the organization's ability to attract and retain younger talent.

# 6. Job satisfaction ratings :
The HR department lacks visualizations to represent job satisfaction ratings, hindering their ability to measure employee engagement and overall job satisfaction levels effectively.
